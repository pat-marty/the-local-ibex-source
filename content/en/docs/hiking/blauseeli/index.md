## Quick Summary

- A quiet hike in the lonely <hl>Uisterstal</hl> to the aptly named
  <hl>Blauseeli</hl>.
- We took the PostAuto to/from <hl>Fafleralp</hl> in the <hl>Lötschental</hl>.
- There were very few people along this route despite us being there on a
  Saturday (with excellent weather).
- Most of the hike along the <hl>Uisterstal</hl> was around T2.
  - The final steep ascent to the <hl>Blauseeli</hl> was in the realm of T3.
- The rocks around the <hl>Blauseeli</hl> are polished flat and served as an
  excellent spot for our lunch break.
- This was the only officially marked trail in the <hl>Uisterstal</hl> so we had
  to hike to and from the lake using the same path.
