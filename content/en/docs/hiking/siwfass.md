## Quick Summary

- A nice and easy _Sonntagsspaziergang_ (Sunday stroll) in a somewhat obscure valley.
- Park at <hl>Käppeliberg</hl> and then take the small cable car up to <hl>Gitschen</hl>.
  - There is a phone at the bottom of the cable car that you need to use to call up to the hut at the top; they will run the cable car then.
  - Cost was around 20.- per person and they only accepted cash (although I think they may also accept Twint now?).
- From Gitschen, we hiked to the <hl>Spilauersee</hl>.
- The ascent to the <hl>Siwfass</hl> from the <hl>Spilauersee</hl> involved first hiking up to the joch between the Hagelstock and the Siwfass and then taking an unofficial path from the joch up to the <hl>Siwfass</hl>.
  - While not being an official hiking path, the dirt path is very visible and easy to follow.
  - Theres a single bench at the top of the <hl>Siwfass</hl> which offers a great view of the surrounding peaks.
- Descended the Siwfass to the west and circled around the Hundstock to get back to <hl>Gitschen</hl>.
- Took the cable car back down to <hl>Käppeliberg</hl>.

  <em>Starting to make our way towards the <hl>Spilauersee</hl>.  This area is a beloved spot in the winter for backcountry skiing and snowshoeing because of its relative proximity to Lucerne and Zug while still being relatively high up.  The <hl>Rossstock</hl> (peak on the very left of the image) is one of the most popular of these winter tours.</em>
