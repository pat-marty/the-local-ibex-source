## Quick Summary

- Took the cable car from <hl>Kies (Talstation)</hl> to the <hl>Stausee Garichti</hl>
  - Can access the cable car either via bus or by car; a decent amount of parking space available here
- Follow the gravel road to Nideren near the <hl>Chärpfbrugg</hl> caves
- Continue following the regular hiking path to the south of the Sunnenberg
- Path leads directly to the <hl>Leglerhütte SAC</hl>
- After a quick lunch, we took the (relatively steep) western path from the hut towards the <hl>Chammseeli</hl>
- Continued north-east from the Chammseeli towards <hl>Ratzmatt</hl>
- Went over the saddle at <hl>Matzlenfurggelen</hl> and then back down to the cable car station at the <hl>Stausee Garichti</hl>

  <em>The <hl>Chärpfbrugg</hl> cave near Nideren.  We opted to go over the cave instead of through it because Pat's geo-spidey senses were telling him that going through a cave that we hadn't researched ahead of time would be a bad idea...</em>

  <em>Most of the path from the Stausee Garichti until the ascent to the <hl>Sunnenbergfurggele</hl> was this style of path — fairly wide and well maintained.</em>

  <em>At the <hl>Sunnenbergfurggele</hl> (the gully just south of the <hl>Sunnenberg</hl>) looking north again towards Glarus.  This is (roughly) the highest point of the hike.</em>

  <em>Looking west from the plateau on which the Leglerhütte is perched.  We will be taking a route which goes down on the south-western side (left-hand-side of the image) and will then continue over this saddle to the lake on the right-hand-side of the image.</em>

  <em>There were a few of these surprisingly large marshes somewhat below the Chammseeli.  The hiking path leads around the lake, so keeping your feet dry isn't an issue here.</em>

  <em>The view south from near the <hl>Matzlenfurggelen</hl>.  <hl>Ratzmatt</hl> is the collection of buildings on the right-hand-side in the valley.  The previous picture was taken at one of the huts up on the plateau in the center of the image.  We didn't take very many pictures from the plateau down to Ratzmatt because the ground was extremely wet and slippery.</em>
