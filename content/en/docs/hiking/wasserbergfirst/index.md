## Quick Summary

- Parked in one of the parking lots close to the Schwyz/Uri border near
  <hl>Liplisbüel</hl>.
- This hike was <hl>very steep</hl> (around 1100m of elevation gain over ~4km).
- The final portion close to the summit of the <hl>Wasserbergfirst</hl> was
  partially secured by chains.
  - These would not have been strictly necessary, but they definitely made the
    ascent/descent more pleasant.
- We had excellent weather conditions when we did this hike.
  - Given the mix of grassy/dirt paths, smooth limestone slabs, and the steep
    terrain, this trail would likely be very problematic when wet.
- In the interest of saving our knees, we decided to descend via the gravel road
  from <hl>Abigweid</hl> to <hl>Grüen Boden</hl>.
