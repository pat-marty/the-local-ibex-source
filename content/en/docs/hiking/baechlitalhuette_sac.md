</p>

## Quick Summary

- Day hike from the <hl>Räterichsbodensee</hl> (near the <hl>Grimsel Pass</hl>) to the <hl>Bächlitalhütte SAC</hl>
- The starting point is easily accessible with both car and public transit
- The ascent and descent take the same path; there is only one officially marked path which leads to the <hl>Bächlitalhütte</hl>
- We'd suggest doing this hike when the ground is dry.  While the hike itself isn't very dangerous, most of the hike is on smooth rocks which can make the path quite slippery when wet

## Ascent to the Bächlital

    <em>The dam at the end of the <hl>Räterichsbodensee</hl>.  There is both a parking lot as well as the PostAuto stop right beside this dam.  The path that leads to the Bächlitalhütte more or less goes straight up the side of the valley at the end of the dam.</em>

    <em>The clouds are a little unpredictable today.  Regardless though, the intermittent periods of clear skies offer some great views down the valley.</em>

    <em>This gives a fairly good idea of what most of the path up to the Bächlisboden glacial runoff plain looks like.  Most of the path is quite narrow and largely consists of these sorts of stone steps.</em>

## Along the Bächlital

    <img src="IMG_1470.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>Turning 180&#176; from where the previous picture was taken, we now have our first view into the <hl>Bächlital</hl>.  Luckily, the clouds are still fairly low and haven't yet made their way into this side valley as a result.</em>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1500.JPG" alt="" class="portrait">
    <em>Making our way up the first part of the <hl>Bächlital</hl>.  The path here is a lot less steep compared to the first part of the hike.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1512.JPG" alt="" class="portrait">
    <em>The path is very well marked and is generally unproblematic.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1535.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>Our first view of the <hl>Bächlisboden</hl> glacial flood plain as well as the <hl>Bächlitalhütte SAC</hl> (perched up on the right-hand-side of the valley at the end of the plain).  The majority of the path leading to the hut hugs the right side of the valley.</em>

    <em>Making our way along the right-hand side of the valley towards the <hl>Bächlitalhütte</hl>.  This is the first part of the hike that wasn't quite as clearly marked as the rest.  With that being said, there's only really one way you can go so it's not a big problem.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1567.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>Only one more short ascent to go until we've reached the hut.</em>

</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1581.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>This portion of the path is again very well marked.  Similar to the first portion of the hike, the path consists mostly of stacked rocks (almost like stair steps) which makes the ascent pretty enjoyable.</em>

## Venturing Beyond the Hut

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1612.JPG" alt="" class="portrait">
    <em>After a relaxing coffee on the patio, we decided to make our way further up the <hl>Bächlital</hl> a little.  We didn't really have a clear goal in mind, but we were curious if we'd get a break in the clouds further up the valley.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1623.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>A really beautiful path.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1629.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>The <hl>Bächligletscher</hl> at the end of the valley.  We have it to thank for this absolutely spectacular valley.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1638.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>You often find moss campion in these rocky terrains where you wouldn't imaging anything would be capable of growing.  Nature is truly amazing.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1643.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>After not having any luck with the clearing cloud cover, we decided to make our way back to the hut and return back to the <hl>Räterichsbodensee</hl>.</em>
</p>

## A Foggy Return

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1651.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>The view from the patio of the <hl>Bächlitalhütte</hl> is really pretty spectacular.  These sorts of braided river systems are typical to find in the mountains close to the melt of a glacier.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1670.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>And now back at the plain, back in rolls the fog.  At least we were lucky enough to have an incredible view over the valley from our vantage point at the hut.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1694.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>This was the majority of the view for the way down.  Not much to see, but still an enjoyable descent.  As mentioned before though, watch out for moss covered rocks on the way down as some of them were quite slippery due to the fog (Bruno wiped out once on a large flat mossy rock on the descent).</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_1708.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>Back at the <hl>Räterichsbodensee</hl>.  It's a bit of a shame that the weather didn't want to cooperate for the latter part of the day, but overall the hike was an absolute blast.  This is definitely one we'll have to do again once in the future on a clearer day.</em>
