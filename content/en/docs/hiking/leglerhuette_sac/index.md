## Ascent via the Chärpfbrugg

![](IMG_7130.JPG "The <hl>Chärpfbrugg</hl> cave near Nideren.  We opted to go over the cave instead of through it because Pat's geo-spidey senses were telling him that going through a cave that we hadn't researched ahead of time would be a bad idea...")

![](IMG_7131.JPG "Most of the path from the Stausee Garichti until the ascent to the <hl>Sunnenbergfurggele</hl> was this style of path — fairly wide and well maintained.")

![](IMG_7132.JPG "At the <hl>Sunnenbergfurggele</hl> (the gully just south of the <hl>Sunnenberg</hl>) looking north again towards Glarus.  This is (roughly) the highest point of the hike.")


## Leglerhütte and Return via Ratzmatt

![](IMG_7142.JPG "Not a bad spot for a lunch break.")

![](IMG_7147.JPG "Looking west from the plateau on which the Leglerhütte is perched.  We then took a route which goes down on the south-western side (left-hand-side of the image) and then continued over this saddle to the lake on the right-hand-side of the image.")

![](IMG_7151.JPG "At the <hl>Chammseeli</hl> looking again towards the <hl>Glärnisch</hl> massif.")

![](IMG_7165.JPG "There were a few of these surprisingly large marshes somewhat below the Chammseeli.  The hiking path leads around the lake, so keeping our feet dry wasn't an issue here.")

![](IMG_7175.JPG "Some fairly typical landscapes for this part of the alps.  The reddish grasses at this time of year always add some nice contrast into the scenery.")

![](IMG_7177.JPG "There were a fair few huts on the way down to Ratzmatt.")

![](IMG_7179.JPG "The view south from near the <hl>Matzlenfurggelen</hl>.  <hl>Ratzmatt</hl> is the collection of buildings on the right-hand-side in the valley.  The previous picture was taken at one of the huts up on the plateau in the center of the image.  We didn't take very many pictures from the plateau down to Ratzmatt because the ground was extremely wet and slippery.")
