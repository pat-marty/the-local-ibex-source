## Quick Summary

- An autumn hike near the <hl>Flüelapass</hl> to the <hl>Jöriseen</hl>.
- We parked near the bus stop <hl>Wägerhus/Abzw. Jöriseen</hl>.
- Hiked the loop counter-clockwise.
  - First hiked to the <hl>Winterlücke</hl> and then later up to the <hl>Jöriflüelafurgga</hl>.
  - We were happy that we chose to do the loop in this orientation since this allowed us to do the crux of the hike (see below) going upwards as opposed to going downwards.
- We'd rate most of the hike as T2 apart from a single passage on the eastern side of the <hl>Jöriflüelafurgga</hl>.
  - This spot was the crux of the hike and was secured by a series of steel cables.
  - This passage was quite exposed and was relatively icy when we were there, thus making it somewhat precarious.

- We made a small detour from the <hl>Winterlücke</hl> to a small, unnamed peak to the north-west of this small pass.
