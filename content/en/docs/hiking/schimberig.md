## Quick Summary

- Relatively short hike up to the <hl>Schimberig</hl>  in southern Lucerne.
- Took the alpine trail (blue-white-blue) up from <hl>Gründli</hl> to the <hl>Schimberig</hl>
  - Parking available.
  - Accessible via PostAuto as well.
- We skipped the option to go over the <hl>Hängst</hl> as there is a fairly sketchy scrambling passage ([T4](../overview/#wanderskala)) that connects the Schimberig to the Hängst.
  - Instead took the path below the south-side of the <hl>Hängst</hl> summit (less exposed)
- Took the regular hiking path to the west of the peak back down to <hl>Gründi</hl> to form a loop.

## Ascent to the Schimberig

  <em>The view from the parking lot.  The white cross on the left-hand side of the ridge at the top of the mountain is the <hl>Schimberig</hl> and the peak to the right of the rocky precipice on the right is the <hl>Hängst</hl>.</em>

  <em>Most of the ascent consists of these kinds of hiking paths (blue-white-blue markings).  Most of the lower parts are fairly well marked, but some of the sections higher up require a little more attention to make sure you stay on the correct path.</em>

  <em>Another view back over the hiking path we'd taken to this point.  Again, not terribly exposed here, but the path itself is fairly steep.</em>

  <em>Starting the ascent to the ridge that leads to the <hl>Hängst</hl>.  While still not particularly exposed, this part of the ridge was very strenuous because of how steep the path is (some sections have upwards of a 40% incline).</em>

  <em>Our first view of the <hl>Hängst</hl> (peak on the right).  Here we opted to follow the official path (left) that leads below the summit of the Hängst.  Part of this section involved crossing the snow field which was by far the sketchiest part of the hike.</em>

  <em>Looking back towards where the previous picture was taken.  This photo was taken directly at the edge of the snow field (behind where I am standing).</em>

  <em>We finally made it up to the ridge between the <hl>Hängst</hl> and the <hl>Schimberig</hl>.  The path we came up was on the right-hand side where the blue waypoint is pointing.  The crux (T4) for the ascent to the Hängst can be seen here on the left; the narrow ridge leading up to the peak has around a 200 m to 300 m drop on both sides.  We decided to skip that one for this time.</em>

  <em>The beautiful panorama view from the ridge.  The summit cross of the <hl>Schimberig</hl> can be seen here on the right.  There were already quite some people there so we decided to find a spot to sit here on the ridge and not near the cross.  (Note: we were pretty much alone on the way up; most of the people at the summit cross took the regular hiking route from the west side of the Schimberig instead.)</em>

## Descent back to Gründli

  <em>After a well deserved lunch, we headed back down on the western side of the <hl>Schimberig</hl>.  The hiking paths for this descent are quite a bit less steep than the alpine trail we took on the way up.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="IMG_0571.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
  <em>Even though we're not terribly high up here, you still have pretty consistent views of the surrounding peaks which is always great.</em>

  <em>The last portion of the hike consists of gravel roads.  Definitely a nice way to end an otherwise fairly steep hike.</em>
