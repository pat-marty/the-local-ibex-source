## Quick Summary

- A <hl>via ferrata</hl> and <hl>alpine hiking</hl> path near the
  <hl>Sustenpass</hl>.
  - There was <hl>no public transit</hl> available to get to the starting
    location.
  - We saw one group that hired an <hl>alp taxi</hl> to pick them up at the
    <hl>Umpol</hl> parking lot, so there may be an option to charter a ride from
    one of the nearby villages.
- We only ended up doing the <hl>first half of the via ferrata</hl> and then
  decided to continue to the hut via the <hl>alpine hiking route</hl>.
  - There were a handful of <hl>slightly overhanging sections</hl> on the first
    part of the via ferrata so our arms were already a little fatigued by the
    point where we decided to make our detour.
  - The via ferrata crossed the hiking path at one location, which is where we
    decided to make this detour.
- We were here on a weekend with excellent weather so the route was quite busy.
