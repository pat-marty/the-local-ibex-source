## Quick Summary

- Took a (completely over-engineered) cable car from <hl>Tierfed</hl> to <hl>Kalktrittli</hl>.
- From <hl>Kalktrittli</hl> we took the newly constructed path which had been blown out of the side of the mountain.
  - While the path is quite wide and very well maintained, it is <hl>extremely</hl> exposed (near-vertical drop of around 800 m).
- Hiked up towards the <hl>Muttenwändli</hl> via the <hl>Nüschentäli</hl>.
  - We had a few small snowfields to cross despite it being mid-summer.
- Coffee and Wähe at the <hl>Muttseehütte SAC</hl>.
- Quick pit-stop on the <hl>Muttenchopf</hl>.
- Descent to the <hl>Limmerensee</hl>.
- Return via the <hl>access tunnel</hl> used for constructing the dams at the Limmerensee and the Muttsee.

## Kalktrittli

![](IMG_1019.JPG "Taking the cable car up from <hl>Tierfed</hl> to <hl>Kalktrittli</hl>.  This cable car was initially built for when they were constructing the expansion to the dam at the Muttsee.  This cable car was built to transport vehicles and huge amounts of materials to the construction site and not a couple tourists looking for an epic hiking trail ;)")

![](IMG_1021.JPG "There are only two official paths that lead to the <hl>Muttseehütte</hl>.  The first one (left arrow; this is the one we'll be taking here) goes up along a newly constructed path to the <hl>Nüschentäli</hl> while the second goes through an access tunnel that leads directly though the mountain.  We'll be taking the access tunnel on the way back.")

![](IMG_1028.JPG "Inside the very industrial looking ''Bergstation'' for the cable car.  Literally looks like we're hanging out in the secret hideout for a James Bond villain.  You can tell this place wasn't initially built with tourism in mind.")

![](IMG_1029.JPG "The slightly ominous looking door leading to the cable car.")


## Nüschentäli to the Muttseehütte

![](IMG_1035.JPG "The <hl>Kalktrittli</hl> cable car station.  This newly constructed path is pretty wide but has a <hl>very</hl> steep drop off; this photo doesn't do the exposure justice.")

![](IMG_1031.JPG "The view forwards towards the Limmerentobel (valley where the sunlight is coming in from).  According to the topography map, it would be around an 800 m drop if we were to fall here.  We definitely had to watch our step.")

![](IMG_1045.JPG "There were a few very short passages like this which were secured by chains.  They definitely wouldn't have been necessary, but it helped to make the ascent a little more relaxed.")

![](IMG_1063.JPG "Looking from the Vorder Nüschenegg towards the <hl>Selbsanft</hl>.  By this point, most of the exposed sections are behind us.")

![](IMG_1070.JPG "A view from the <hl>Nüschentäli</hl> looking west towards the <hl>Clariden</hl> (one of the peaks near the expansive glacier).")

![](IMG_1094.JPG "A few snowfields still hanging around despite it being mid-summer.  Nothing too problematic though.")

![](IMG_1103.JPG "It always seems like magic to me that moss campion is able to thrive in these extremely rocky areas where seemingly nothing else wants to grow.  Truly beautiful.")

![](IMG_1135.JPG "Our first view of the <hl>Limmerensee</hl>.  The grassy plateau on the left is the <hl>Muttenchopf</hl>.  We're going to make a stop there after we stop for a coffee at the <hl>Muttseehütte</hl>.")

![](IMG_1141.JPG "The <hl>Muttsee</hl>.  Most of the tunnel infrastructure we'll be seeing later was built for an expansion project for this hydroelectric dam.  The <hl>Muttseehütte</hl> (not visible here) is just out of frame on the right-hand-side.")

![](IMG_1177.JPG "At the <hl>Muttseehütte SAC</hl>.")

![](IMG_1168.JPG "Refueling with some delicious Wähe and coffee.")


## Muttenchopf and the Limmerensee

![](IMG_1194.JPG "After we'd finished our coffee, we continued on towards the <hl>Muttenchopf</hl>.  Here we're looking back towards the <hl>Muttseehütte</hl>.")

![](IMG_1180.JPG "This glacial valley is absolutely incredible.  It's uncommon to find these sorts of fjord-like valleys in Switzerland.  The <hl>Muttenchopf</hl> is the plateau on the right side.")

![](IMG_1189.JPG "The view down to the <hl>Limmerensee</hl> from the <hl>Muttenchopf</hl>.")

![](IMG_1202.JPG "This is the kind of place I imagine Swiss geology students go to for fieldwork.  Apart from all of the well defined folds, the offset layer to the left of the snow covered gully might be the most spectacular textbook example of a reverse fault I have ever seen.")

![](IMG_1203.JPG "Making our way down towards the <hl>Limmerensee</hl>.  We were really impressed with how well the hiking path is maintained here (even for Swiss standards).")

![](IMG_1213.JPG "Another view down towards the Limmerensee.")

![](IMG_1222.JPG "Plenty of alproses to add some colour to the somewhat rocky terrain.")

![](IMG_1231.JPG "This place is so peaceful.  We had the trail almost entirely to ourselves.")

![](IMG_1234.JPG "A short scrambling passage secured by chains.  It's not at all exposed though.")

![](IMG_1248.JPG "Finally down at the <hl>Limmerensee</hl>.  This is the first part of the hike where we saw quite a number of people.  There was a school class here for a field trip, but they had only taken the cable car up and walked through the access tunnel to get here (hence, not taking the hiking trail).  That approach would likely make for a good family outing on a weekend.")


## Return Through the Access Tunnel
<hl>NOTE: We were REQUIRED to wear a safety vest through the tunnel.  There was a box with a bunch of them at the door leading into the tunnel; we took one from this bin and then deposited it back in the box at the other end of the tunnel.</hl>

![](IMG_1253.JPG "Pretty neat that they make this accessible to the public.  It is also quite a nice shortcut without which this hike would likely not have been doable in a day.")

![](IMG_1266.JPG "There are some pretty neat little side tunnels we explored here as well.  This particular one lets you go onto the dam at the end of the Limmerensee.")

![](IMG_1268.JPG "It really is pretty incredible what's possible to build using the state of the art in engineering.")

![](IMG_1287.JPG "The relatively long return back to the cable car.  This tunnel leads directly back to the ''James Bond villain lair'' where we got the cable car back down to <hl>Tierfed</hl>.")

## Quick Summary

- Beautiful autumn hike to the <hl>Muttseehütte SAC</hl>.
  - Planned to take the same path as in 2021.
- Upon returning to the cable car at <hl>Kalktrittli</hl>, we were informed that the cable car was closed for the rest of the day due to <hl>high winds</hl>.
  - Had to hike down from <hl>Kalktrittli</hl> to <hl>Tierfed</hl>.
- Much of the decent from <hl>Kalktrittli</hl> was through the forest which was quite scenic given the <hl>autumn leaves</hl>.
