## Quick Summary

- A very scenic but quite physically demanding hike to a lesser-known SAC hut near one of Switzerland's most iconic landmarks.
- Took the train to/from <hl>Zermatt</hl>.
- There were virtually no flat sections to this hike — essentially the entire tour consisted of either steep inclines/declines.
- The hut itself was quite "<hl>old-school</hl>" in the sense that it had not undergone any major renovations or additions when we visited.
  - Despite the hut being nearly full, there was only a single other person staying at the hut who was ***not*** undertaking a high-alpine mountaineering expedition.
  - This gave the hut quite a <hl>unique vibe</hl> (eg. at dinner) as everyone that was there was exceptionally passionate and knowledgeable about alpine sports.
