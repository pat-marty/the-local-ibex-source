## Quick Summary

- A very warm hike to the <hl>Kröntenhütte SAC</hl> near the city of <hl>Erstfeld</hl>.
- <hl>Special permit required</hl> to drive up the <hl>Erstfeldertal</hl>; a day permit costs about 20.- and can be purchased at the Kiosk outside of the Migros on Gotthardstrasse
- Suggested to hike up the southern side of the valley instead of the northern side.  Most people seem to hike up along the river on the north side so you will likely have the trail mostly to yourself if you hike up on the southern side
- As you will be able to tell from the thick green foliage, this valley is quite temperate.  It is worth going early in the morning as it can get extremely hot here later in the day during the summer months
- It is worth making a stop at the <hl>Obersee</hl> near the <hl>Kröntenhütte</hl>

    <em>Despite the foliage being extremely thick, there are frequent clearings that give you a nice panorama of the valley.</em>

    <em>Once we started getting a little higher up, the trees began to clear and we had more consistent views of the surrounding mountains.</em>

## Kröntenhütte and the Obersee

The fuorcla (saddle) on the left side of the image is the <hl>Steinchälenfurggli</hl> which has an alpine path (marked white-blue-white) that goes over to the next valley to the <hl>Leutschahhütte SAC</hl>.</em>

## Return Along the Alpbach

    <em>The only (slightly) exposed part of the hike.  This short passage is immediately after the <hl>Fulensee</hl> and takes you down to the <hl>Alpbach</hl> river.  While the path here is quite wide and most of the descent is secured by chains, I could imagine this being a little more sketchy when wet.</em>

    <em>Some of the rather turbulent falls along the <hl>Alpbach</hl>.  Despite being named a "bach" (which in German means stream or creek), I think describing it as a river is a little more fitting.</em>

    <em>Once again getting back below the tree line.  The water is glacial runoff and is ice cold as a result.  Definitely don't want to fall in here...</em>
