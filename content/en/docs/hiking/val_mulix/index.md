## Quick Summary

- Autumn hike in <hl>Graubünden</hl> near <hl>Preda</hl>.
- Parked the car near <hl>Naz</hl>.
  - There is a nearby <hl>train station</hl> in <hl>Preda</hl> which could serve
    as an alternative.
- Hiked up along the <hl>Val Mulix</hl> and continued south towards the <hl>Alp
  Mulix</hl>.
  - From this point onwards, there was only really one hiking path for us to
    follow.
- The path was quite icy so we were glad to have our <hl>trekking poles</hl> and
  <hl>snow spikes</hl> (lightweight crampons) with us.
- We did not go all the way up to the <hl>Lai Negr</hl> because the icy
  conditions on some of the boulder fields were a little precarious.
- This was a very quiet route — we didn't see anyone else the entire day.
- There were many <hl>larch trees</hl> along the way which added a beautiful
  splash of colour to the scenery.
