## Sidelenhütte SAC

![](IMG_6922.JPG "Our first view of the <hl>Sidelenhütte</hl> — still a ways to go until we get there though.")

![](IMG_6924.JPG "Looking back towards the <hl>Furkapass</hl>.")

![](IMG_6929.JPG "There are a few of these small lakes along the way up to the <hl>Sidelenhütte</hl> — typical landscape for these sorts of post-glacial landscapes.")

![](IMG_6930.JPG "The path leading to the <hl>Albert-Heim Hütte</hl> is the one we took and is locally known as the <hl>Nepali Highway</hl>.")


## Nepali Highway

![](IMG_6932.JPG "The start of the <hl>Nepali Highway</hl> shortly after leaving the <hl>Sidelenhütte</hl>.  This is one of a hand-full of scrambling passages.")

![](IMG_6933.JPG "Another look back up towards some of the scrambling passages.  Most of the trickier passages here are secured with a combination of ropes, steel cables, or rebar steps.")

![](IMG_6934.JPG "This gives a pretty good impression of what most of the <hl>Nepali Highway</hl> looks like.")

![](IMG_6937.JPG "Apparently this is area is very beloved by climbers.  I've highlighted a few groups that were making their way up this cliff here.")

![](IMG_6940.JPG "Looking down towards <hl>Tiefenbach</hl>.  The parking lot we parked at can be seen a stones-throw to the left of the restaurant.")

![](IMG_6942.JPG "The path thus far was pretty well marked and was overall very enjoyable to traverse.")

![](IMG_6948.JPG "Shortly before the tarn at the base of the <hl>Tiefengletscher</hl> became visible, there was another short scrambling passage across some boulders.  Some of the boulders were pretty unstable so we had to be somewhat mindful of our hand/footholds.")


## Tiefengletscher and the Albert-Heim Hütte SAC

![](IMG_6958.JPG "Our first view of the <hl>Tiefengletscher</hl> and the tarn at the base of it.")

![](IMG_6982.JPG "A view towards the <hl>Albert-Heim Hütte</hl>; the hut can be seen perched up on one of the rock formations in the center of the image.")

![](IMG_7007.JPG "The landscape here is absolutely incredible.")

![](IMG_7010.JPG "Nearly at the <hl>Albert-Heim Hütte</hl>.")

![](IMG_7011.JPG "The <hl>Albert-Heim Hütte SAC</hl> with the <hl>Tiefengletscher</hl> in the background.  We stopped here for a drink and then continued to the <hl>Schafberg</hl>.")


## Schafberg and Return to Tiefenbach

![](IMG_7019.JPG "Shortly before the top of the <hl>Schafberg</hl>.  The <hl>Schafberg</hl> is only about a 10-15 minute hike from the <hl>Albert-Heim Hütte</hl>.")

![](IMG_7015.JPG "At the top of the <hl>Schafberg</hl>.  We didn't stick around long since we had just taken a break at the <hl>Albert-Heim Hütte</hl>.")

![](IMG_7028.JPG "The view down the <hl>Hospental</hl> towards <hl>Rehalp</hl> and <hl>Andermatt</hl> (both not visible here).")
