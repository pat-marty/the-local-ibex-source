## Quick Summary

- Spring hike to the <hl>Gnipen</hl> up the <hl>Goldauer Bergsturz</hl>.
- Excellent public transit access.
  - Took a train to <hl>Arth-Goldau</hl>.
  - Returned from the train station in <hl>Steinerberg</hl>.
- Ascended via the scarp from a large slope failure that happened in the 19th century.
- Due to the snow only having recently melted, the ground was <hl>extremely
  wet</hl>.
  - This made the ground very muddy and exceedingly <hl>slippery</hl>.
- This is my 4th (?) time on the Gnipen/Wildspitz, but I don't think I would
  take this route again unless the ground were completely dry.
  - The wet trail conditions made the ascent unpleasant and I ended up changing
    my route on the way down so that I could (mostly) descend on the paved roads
    to avoid the slippery trails.
