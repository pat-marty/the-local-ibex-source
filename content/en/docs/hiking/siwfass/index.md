## Quick Summary

- A nice and easy _Sonntagsspaziergang_ (Sunday stroll) in a somewhat obscure valley.
- Park at <hl>Käppeliberg</hl> and then take the small cable car up to <hl>Gitschen</hl>.
  - There is a phone at the bottom of the cable car that you need to use to call up to the hut at the top; they will run the cable car then.
  - Cost was around 20.- per person and they only accepted cash (although I think they may also accept Twint now?).
- From Gitschen, we hiked to the <hl>Spilauersee</hl>.
- The ascent to the <hl>Siwfass</hl> from the <hl>Spilauersee</hl> involved first hiking up to the joch between the Hagelstock and the Siwfass and then taking an unofficial path from the joch up to the <hl>Siwfass</hl>.
  - While not being an official hiking path, the dirt path was very visible and easy to follow.
  - There was a single bench at the top of the <hl>Siwfass</hl> which offered a great view of the surrounding peaks.
- Descended the Siwfass to the west and circled around the Hundstock to get back to <hl>Gitschen</hl>.
- Took the cable car back down to <hl>Käppeliberg</hl>.

## Spilauersee

![](IMG_0958.JPG "The cable car which goes from <hl>Käppeliberg</hl> to <hl>Gitschen</hl>.  There is only room for 4 or 5 people inside.")

![](IMG_0796.JPG "A view back to <hl>Gitschen</hl>.  One of these huts is where the cable car station is.")

![](IMG_0799.JPG "Starting to make our way towards the <hl>Spilauersee</hl>.  This area is a beloved spot in the winter for backcountry skiing and snowshoeing because of its relative proximity to Lucerne and Zug while still being relatively high up.  The <hl>Rossstock</hl> (peak on the very left of the image) is one of the most popular of these winter tours.")

![](IMG_0828.JPG "A small hut located just above the <hl>Spilauersee</hl> (visible on the right-hand-side of the image).")


## Siwfass

![](IMG_0871.JPG "Looking back from the joch between the <hl>Hagelstock</hl> and the <hl>Siwfass</hl>.  The peak on the left-hand-side is the <hl>Rossstock</hl>.  There's still a surprising amount of snow up here despite being mid-summer.")

![](IMG_0866.JPG "The view southward towards the Hoch Fulen (large peak in the center) from the plateau just below the <hl>Siwfass</hl>.")

![](IMG_0882.JPG "The <hl>Hundstock</hl> (literally means ''dog stick'') as seen from the ascent to the <hl>Siwfass</hl>.")

![](IMG_0885.JPG "A view westward towards the <hl>Diepen</hl>.  After we descend from the Siwfass, we'll be making our way from left to right across this flat plain.")

![](IMG_0892.JPG "At the top of the <hl>Siwfass</hl>.  A nice little spot to enjoy a bite to eat.")


## Return to Gitschen

![](IMG_0897.JPG "After making our way down from the Siwfass, we headed westward toward the <hl>Schön Chulm</hl>.  This is a view towards the <hl>Siwfass</hl> (peak in the center).  The path to the top first leads below the near-vertical rock face and then doubles back over the ridge to the top.")

![](IMG_0899.JPG "There were a ton of wildflowers down near the <hl>Schön Chulm</hl>.  This is the view southward towards the Gotthard.")

![](IMG_0920.JPG "Incredible colours here.  Here looking towards the Urnersee (south-eastern part of the Vierwaldstättersee).")

![](IMG_0928.JPG "A waypoint slightly to the north of Schön Chulm.")

![](IMG_0932.JPG "Continuing north between the Tibistock and the Hundstock, here we are looking back towards the Siwfass (peak on the right).")

![](IMG_0942.JPG "Gradually approaching the treeline again.  The ridge behind Bruno on the other side of the valley is the Chlingenstock (Stoos).")

![](IMG_0953.JPG "On the north side of the Hundstock we started running into some very curious cows.  Apart from a single photographer we met near the Spilauersee, these cows were the only other living things we saw the whole hike.")

![](IMG_0955.JPG "Once again back at <hl>Gitschen</hl>.  The cable car is just beside the barn on the bottom left part of the image.")
