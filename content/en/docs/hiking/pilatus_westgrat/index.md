## Quick Summary

- A scenic but very exposed hike along the entire western ridge of the <hl>Pilatus</hl>.
- Started in <hl>Gfellen</hl>.
  - Took the train to <hl>Entlebuch</hl> and then had a short ride with the PostAuto to <hl>Gfellen</hl>.
- The first portion of the hike was through grassy fields and then a densely forested area.
- The ascent up to the first peak (<hl>Blaue Tosse</hl>) was somewhat steep but not particularly exposed.
  - The ridge traverse started after the <hl>Blaue Tosse</hl>.
- There were several exposed sections on the way to the <hl>Tripolihütte</hl>, but most of the trickier sections were secured by chains.

- The ascent up to the <hl>Mittaggüpfi</hl> was somewhat steep but it was, again, well secured by chains.
- Descended down to the saddle between the <hl>Mittaggüpfi</hl> and the <hl>Widderfeld</hl> before ascending to the <hl>Widderfeld</hl>.
  - This section was quite steep but not particularly exposed.

- I found the descent from the <hl>Widderfeld</hl> heading towards the start of the western ridge to be <hl>the most challenging part of the hike</hl>.
  - There was a short but near-vertical scrambling section that was very exposed.
  - As with most of the other exposed sections, this was again accompanied by chains.

- In the northern couloir beneath the <hl>Widderfeld</hl> there was a single snowfield that need crossing.
- The path that led up to the start of the ridge was relatively wide, but the subsequent ridge path was very narrow.
  - This western ridge to the <hl>Tomlishorn</hl> was extremely exposed (\>200 meter near-vertical drop on both sides).
  - There were two short scrambling passages over this ridge that were again secured with chains.

- The final stretch from the <hl>Tomlishorn</hl> to the <hl>Pilatus</hl> consisted of a paved path.
