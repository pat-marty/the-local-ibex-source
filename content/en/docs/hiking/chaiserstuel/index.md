## Quick Summary

- A nice hike across many meadows in <hl>Nidwalden</hl>.
- Drove to <hl>Fell</hl> near <hl>Oberrickenbach</hl>.
  - Took two very small cable cars (so-called <hl>Buiräbähnli</hl>) up to the starting point.
    - The first was <hl>Luftseilbahn Fell-Spis</hl>.
    - The second was <hl>Luftseilbahn Spis-Sinsgäu</hl>.
  - On the way down we took the <hl>Luftseilbahn Fell-Chrüzhütte</hl>.
- The ascent up to the ridge leading to the <hl>Chaiserstuel</hl> was extremely steep (marked <hl>blue-white-blue</hl>) so we were quite happy to have had our poles with us.
- There was only one very short (~15m) scrambling passage to get to the top of the Chaiserstuel.
- We hiked part-way to the <hl>Bietstöck</hl> but decided to turn around before getting to the cross because it was extremely exposed.
