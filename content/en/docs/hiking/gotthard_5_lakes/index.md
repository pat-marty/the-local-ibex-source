## Quick Summary

- A loop hike starting from the <hl>Gotthardpass</hl> and visiting 5 different lakes along the way.
  - We did the hike clockwise.
- Parked near the <hl>La Claustra</hl> bunker hotel.
- There were 5 named lakes along the loop, but there were also numerous other small ponds along the way as well.
- We took a brief lunch break at the <hl>Gatscholalücke</hl>.
  - This was definitely the highlight of the hike for us given the beautiful view towards the <hl>Furkapass</hl> we had from this vantage point.
- While the trail was very quiet when we were there in the autumn, this is likely not one we will add to our to-do list for an upcoming summer.
  - Given how accessible this route is, we would expect it to be quite busy during the warmer months.
