## Arrival

We parked near the <hl>Sustenbrüggli</hl> restaurant (there's a decently sized
parking lot there).  You could alternatively take the PostAuto to the stop
<hl>Meien, Sustenbrüggli</hl>, although we'd suggest taking a car instead since
this is a fairly lengthy hike and you'll want to get started early in the
morning.  

Alternatively, you could arrive the evening before and stay at the <hl>Sustlihütte SAC</hl> to get an early start the next morning.

</p>

## Sustlihütte SAC (Leiterweg)

The first part of this hike has two possible routes: the <hl>Normalweg</hl>
(normal path) or the <hl>Leiterweg</hl> (ladder path).  The ladder path involves
4 ladders and is quite a good warmup for some of the trickier passages later on
in the hike.  The spots with the ladders are very well secured and are not
particularly exposed.  With that being said, two of the ladders are somewhat
high, so being comfortable with heights is important.

At the end of the <hl>Leiterweg</hl> you'll have reached the first waypoint of
the day: the <hl>Sustlihütte SAC</hl>.  We didn't stick around here for long
since the ascent up from the parking lot wasn't particularly long and we wanted
to keep moving.  

Although the Leiterweg had been been marked as a mountain hiking path
(white-red-white markings), the path as we continued on from the Sustlihütte SAC
changed over to an alpine path (white-blue-white markings).

## Traverse Across the Stöss

The hike from the Sustlihütte SAC to the base of the <hl>Guferjoch</hl> was a ton of fun.  Beautiful views, fun terrain, not a soul around...  Just an all around great trail.  There are one or two slightly exposed spots along the traverse along the <hl>Stöss</hl>, but the path overall is fairly well marked.

    <em>About half way between the <hl>Sustlihütte SAC</hl> and the <hl>Guferjoch</hl>.  The Guferjoch is one of the chimneys on the right-hand side of the image.</em>
</p>

Remember to always stop and turn around to enjoy those views, the dramatic shadows down the valley were truly incredible.

## Ascent to the Guferjoch

As is the case with many mountain paths, it's not at all visible from the vantage point of the Sustlihütte.  Here's the approximate path to reach the Guferjoch:

<p align="center">
    <img src="guferjoch_annotated_1.png" alt="" class="portrait">
    <em>The path leading to the <hl>Guferjoch</hl>.</em>
</p>

While most of the path so far had been in the realm of [T3](../overview/#wanderskala), the ascent to the Guferjoch seems to typically be rated at around a [T4+](../overview/#wanderskala).  There are a number of fairly sketchy scrambling passages which are largely secured by chains and steel cables.  The route up the rock-face to the joch can be seen here:

<p align="center">
    <img src="guferjoch_annotated_2.png" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>The ascent to the <hl>Guferjoch</hl>.</em>
</p>

The first portion of the scramble is secured by a single long steel wire.  This wire makes the first part of the ascent considerably easier since good handholds can be somewhat tricky to find in places due to the rocks having been smoothed considerably from glacial erosion.

    <img src="IMG_4841.JPG" alt="" class="portrait">

</p>

Following this first scramble, you then have to traverse to the right-hand side of the rock-face, which is secured by a number of chains.

    <em>The second portion of the ascent which requires a traverse to the right-hand side of the rock-face.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_4843.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>The terrain here is quite exposed; good thing there is an abundance of handholds with the chains/cables.</em>
</p>

The third and final traverse moves back to the left-hand side of the face, back towards the joch.  This is by far the most challenging part of the ascent due to there being several small near-vertical scrambling sections.

Once at the top, you're greeted with an incredible view over both sides of the valley — the sweat it took to get up here was definitely worth it!

## Descent to the Sustenlochfirn

The descent from the Guferjoch to the <hl>Sustenlochfirn</hl> was somewhat similar to the ascent to the Guferjoch with most of the route being secured by chains.  There are again a few near-vertical sections that are somewhat tricky to traverse here.  The approximate route can be seen below:

    <img src="guferjoch_annotated_3.png" alt="" class="portrait">
    <em>The descent from the <hl>Guferjoch</hl> to the <hl>Sustenlochfirn</hl>.Note that the upper part of the descent (part indicated with a dashed line) is not visible from this perspective.</em>
</p>

Something to keep an eye on when you get to the <hl>Sustenlochfirn</hl> is that there are two paths you can take across the firn.  The first (older) path goes part way across the firn, over the rock, and then back onto the firn.  However, two hikers that we met on our way down from the joch suggested we follow the (new) path, which leads all the way across the firn.

## Sustenpass

The hike back to the <hl>Sustenpass</hl> was considerably more relaxed than the ascent/descent to the <hl>Guferjoch</hl>.  There were quite a few snowfields that needed crossing, but none of them were exposed.

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_4896.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>There are several additional snowfields that need crossing on the way back to the <hl>Sustenpass</hl>.</em>
</p>

The path is generally well marked, both on the path and when crossing the snowfields.  Note that the portions across some of the snowfields are occasionally marked by Steimännli (deliberately placed piles of rocks) as opposed to white-blue-white markings.

## Return via 19th Century Pass Road

Once we got to the <hl>Sustenpass</hl>, we walked along the old 19th century pass road to get back to <hl>Sustenbrüggli</hl>.  This was a nice chill way to end an otherwise (fairly) strenuous hike.  It's also very impressive to see the engineering they already had back in the day.
