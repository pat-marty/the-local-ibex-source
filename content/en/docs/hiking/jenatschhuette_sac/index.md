## Quick Summary

- A 2 day hike in central Graubünden near the Julierpass.
- Tour was accessible via <hl>public transit</hl>, but we opted to go with the
  car instead.
  - Parked at the <hl>Julierpass</hl>.
  - Returned via the same route on the second day.
- Some parts of this route were not part of the officially marked hiking trails:
  - <hl>Corn Alv</hl>
  - <hl>Fuorcla da Flix</hl> and <hl>Tschima da Flix</hl>
- An alternative which may be preferable if doing this all with the <hl>public
  transit</hl> is to descend from the <hl>Jenatschhütte</hl> down to
  <hl>Spinas</hl> instead of returning back to the <hl>Julierpass</hl>.
  - There is a <hl>train station</hl> in <hl>Spinas</hl> which may be more
    convenient than having to take the PostAuto from the Julierpass.
- A somewhat <hl>easier alternative</hl> to this route is to leave out the
  <hl>Corn Alv</hl> as well as the <hl>Tschima da Flix</hl>.

## Quick Summary

- We followed the official hiking trail from the <hl>Julierpass</hl> towards the
  <hl>Fuorcla d'Agnel</hl>.
- After reaching the long, flat plateau along the <hl>Val d'Agnel</hl>, we
  decided to go east towards the <hl>Corn Alv</hl>.
  - Ascended to the saddle leading to the north-ridge of the <hl>Corn Alv</hl>.
- The ascent to the <hl>Corn Alv</hl> was moderately exposed on quite loose
  rock.
  - <hl>Trekking poles</hl> were very useful for this section.
- After a lunch break at the summit, we returned back down to the saddle via the
  <hl>north-ridge</hl> and then made our way back west towards the <hl>Fuorcla
  d'Agnel</hl>.
- From the <hl>Fuorcla d'Agnel</hl> we made our way down to the nameless glacial
  lake at the toe of the <hl>Vadret d'Agnel</hl> and continued north towards the
  <hl>Jenatschhütte</hl>.
  - The route on the next day would continue up the western side of the valley,
    so we made sure to get an impression of what the ascent would look like
    since we'd be doing this in the dark.

## Quick Summary

- After a 04:00 AM start, we made our way south towards the <hl>nameless
  lake</hl> we passed the day before.
- From the lake, we continued west toward the <hl>Fuorcla da Flix</hl>.
  - While not officially marked, we were able to find our way using the stone
    piles ("<hl>Steimännli</hl>") as waypoints.
- Once we reached the <hl>Fuorcla da Flix</hl>, we continued along the
  south-ridge towards the <hl>Tschima da Flix</hl>.
  - We found the ridge to be quite wide, although there were a handful of
    scrambling sections that required the use of our hands.
- We reached the <hl>Tschima da Flix (Westgipfel)</hl> shortly before sunrise
  and then headed back down the south-ridge.
  - The ridge towards the main peak of the <hl>Tschima da Flix</hl> looked more
    exposed than the ascent to the Westgipfel, so we opted to leave this out for
    this time.
- After sunrise, we descended back down to the <hl>Fuorcla da Flix</hl> and then
  returned to the <hl>Julierpass</hl> via the <hl>Fuorcla d'Agnel</hl> (same
  route as from the day before).
