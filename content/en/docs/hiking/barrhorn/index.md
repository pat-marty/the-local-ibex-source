### Turtmannhütte SAC

![](IMG_5622.JPG "The path up to the Turtmannhütte was very well marked.")

![](IMG_5627.JPG "Some Edelweiss — not a particularly common sight in the mountains.")

### Summary

- With this being the most strenuous of the three days, our primary objective for the day was to summit the <hl>Üssers Barrhorn</hl>
- The crux of the hike was a short ascent up a somewhat exposed couloir
  - This was secured by a metal wire which acted as a handhold
  - Since it was raining on our descent, this section was quite slippery given the fairly smooth rock
- The remainder of the hike consists mainly of moraine and scree

### An Early Start up the Gässi
*We started the next morning around 4 AM to try and beat the inclimate weather which was scheduled to roll in around lunch time.  The crux of the hike (see below) was only about a 30 minute walk from the hut; there was only one officially marked trail that lead to the crux.*

![](IMG_5640.JPG "The crux of the hike.  The ascent up this couloir (known as the <hl>Gässi</hl>) was secured by a metal wire.  It is somewhat exposed, so falling here would be less than ideal.")

![](IMG_5641.JPG "The crux as seen from above.")

![](IMG_5643.JPG "Once we were above the Gässi, we had an absolutely incredible view of the alpenglow on the surrounding peaks.  The prominent peak in the center is the <hl>Bishorn</hl>.")

![](IMG_5645.JPG "Looking back towards the Turtmannspitze.")


### Ascent to the Üssers Barrhorn

![](IMG_5651.JPG "A short scrambling passage about 600m below the summit of the Barrhorn (not visible here).")

![](IMG_5652.JPG "Bruno making his way through the 'Steiwüesti' ('rock desert').  A good chunk of the ascent consisted of this kind of terrain.")

![](IMG_5657.JPG "Our first proper view of the <hl>Üssers Barrhorn</hl> (the peak which is furthest to the left).  The word 'Üssers' is Swiss German for 'Äußeres', meaning 'outer'.")

![](IMG_5660.JPG "While most of the hike is relatively well-marked, there are some sections (like here) that are marked with Steimännli instead of with conventional painted trail markers.  This spot is about 200m - 300m below the summit.")

![](IMG_5674.JPG "Almost at the summit.  It's such a strange feeling to be higher than a lot of the other surrounding peaks.")

![](IMG_5671.JPG "The summit cross.  What an incredible view.")

![](IMG_5670.JPG "The view south-west from the summit.  Most of the path up to the Üssers Barrhorn goes over the ridge on the edge of the Brunegggletscher (closest glacier relative to us).")

![](IMG_5672.JPG "One final view from the summit before heading down to the Schöllijoch.  The forecast was predicting that the weather would turn sour around noon, so we wanted to make our way down before the snow and rain rolled in.")


### Descent to the Schöllijoch 

![](landing_banner.png "Shortly after leaving the summit.  The <hl>Inners Barrhorn</hl> is the left-most peak, with the <hl>Brunegghorn</hl> and <hl>Bishorn</hl> to the right of that.")

![](IMG_5700.JPG "Nearly at the <hl>Schöllijoch</hl>; this is the saddle where the yellow-orange rocks are concentrated.")

![](IMG_5693.JPG "The <hl>Üssers Barrhorn</hl> as seen from just below the <hl>Inners Barrhorn</hl>.")

![](IMG_5705.JPG "Almost at the <hl>Schöllijoch</hl>; if you look closely, you can see the waypoint on the right-hand-side.  The <hl>Brunegghorn</hl> (peak in the center of the image) is already shrouded in the promised clouds.  It's about time we get off this mountain.")

![](IMG_5709.JPG "Looking back towards the <hl>Inners Barrhorn</hl> (right) and the <hl>Üssers Barrhorn</hl> (left).  The group that is traversing below the <hl>Inners Barrhorn</hl> was on their way up to the <hl>Üssers Barrhorn</hl>.  However, when we met them later at the Turtmannhütte, they said that it started snowing once they approached the summit.  I guess starting early payed off.")


### Return to the Turtmannhütte SAC

![](IMG_5711.JPG "The descent down from the Schöllijoch.  Much of the lower part of the trail goes over one of the moraines.")

![](IMG_5713.JPG "Some very precariously perched rocks above the hiking trail.")

![](IMG_5714.JPG "The return over the moraine back to the <hl>Turtmannhütte</hl>.  It began raining shortly after this picture was taken.")

### Hiking Along the Turtmanntal

![](IMG_5715.JPG "The view just north of the <hl>Turtmannhütte</hl> looking northwards down the Turtmanntal.  The terrain here is in stark contrast to the rocky moraines we were hiking over the day before.")

![](IMG_5716.JPG "It was raining on-and-off for much of the day.  Spirits were high from the previous day though, so we were happy as can be.")

![](IMG_5720.JPG "There were several passages like this over loose or otherwise dislocated rock.")

![](IMG_5724.JPG "Lots of clouds around, but luckily not where we were.")

![](IMG_5725.JPG "The end of the Turtmanntal shrouded in clouds.  We would soon begin our descent down to <hl>Gruben</hl> from here.")

![](IMG_5726.JPG "An interesting rockfall/avalanche barrier directly above Gruben (the village of Gruben is down to the left; out of view).  We thought it was pretty neat that the hiking trail goes over the ridge of this quasi-dam.")

![](IMG_5728.JPG "Making our way down to the village through the forest.  The trees gave us some respite from the wind.  While the weather may have been so-so, this was a great way to end an epic trip.")

[^1]: There was indeed an alp taxi that was part of the standard SBB timetable.  However, it drove very infrequently so we decided to charter an alp taxi ride from Gruben back to Oberems.  While quite a bit more expensive than the standard alp taxi faire, it was well worth the cost given how many hours of waiting we ended up saving.
