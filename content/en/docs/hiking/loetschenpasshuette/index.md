## Quick Summary

- Took the train to <hl>Kandersteg</hl> and then an <hl>alp taxi</hl> to
  <hl>Selde</hl>.
  - The alp taxi required a <hl>reservation ahead of time</hl>.
- From <hl>Selde</hl> we took the only path leading up to the
  <hl>Lötschenpasshütte</hl>.
  - The path was well marked and quite easy to follow.
- We needed to cross the remnants of the <hl>Lötschegletscher</hl>.
  - There was hardly anything left of the glacier when we were there.
  - What was left over was mostly covered in scree, so crossing it was
    unproblematic.
- There was one short steep passage shortly before the hut which was secured
  with <hl>steel cables/chains</hl>.
- There was a route which was not labelled on SwissTopo, but which had
  <hl>white-blue-white</hl> markings to the east of the hut.
  - This is the route leading to the <hl>Hockenhorn</hl>.
  - We saw quite a few <hl>ibex</hl> here.
  ![](loetschenpasshuette-25.jpg "The epitome of 'local' ibexes.")
- We didn't end up going all the way to the top of the <hl>Hockenhorn</hl> as
  there was still quite a bit of snow.

## Quick Summary

- Pat got up for an early <hl>sunrise</hl> and went to a vantage point along
  the white-blue-white ridge leading to the <hl>Hockenhorn</hl>.
  - While the weather conditions weren't particularly favourable, he still
    managed to snap some pictures of a few of the Walliser 4000ers, so it
    wasn't a complete bust :wink:
    ![](loetschenpasshuette-37.jpg "The three most prominent peaks from left to right: The <hl>Weisshorn</hl> (shrouded in clouds), <hl>Zinalrothorn</hl>, and <hl>Matterhorn</hl>.")
- We hiked down to the south-east from the <hl>Lötschenpasshütte</hl> to the
  <hl>Hockuchriz</hl>.
  - This spot offered a nice vantage point over the entire <hl>Lötschental</hl>.
- Continued east to <hl>Stafel (Lauchernalp)</hl> from where we took a chairlift
  down to the <hl>Lauchernalp</hl> cable car station.
  - From here we took the cable car down to <hl>Wiler (Lötschen;
    Talstation)</hl>, from where we could take the PostAuto back.
