## Quick Summary

- Hike near <hl>Ziegelbr√ºcke</hl>.
  - We parked at the cable car station and then took the cable car up to
    <hl>Morgenholz</hl>.
  - This spot is quite close to Zurich (less than an hour drive).
- The hike is a loop with some possibilities for extending the route along the
  ridge.
- We had rather unfortunate weather which obscured the view of the
  <hl>Walensee</hl>.
  - With clear conditions, one _should_ have a good view of the Walensee from
    the top.
