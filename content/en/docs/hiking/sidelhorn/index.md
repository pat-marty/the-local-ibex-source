## A Very Foggy Approach

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_2989.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>After a very long discussion in the restaurant at the <hl>Grimsel Passhöhe</hl> about whether to try and tackle the <hl>Sidelhorn</hl> or if we'd be better off going further down into the Wallis where the weather might have been more favourable, we decided to go with our initial plan of ascending the Sidelhorn.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3017.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>It was extremely foggy for most of the way up to the <hl>Sidelhorn</hl>.  It was only once we got further up that we were able to peek above the clouds.  Luckily the path is very well marked.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3021.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>A view of the path we'd taken up to the ridge line.  After not having a viewing distance of more than about 10 m for most of the hike, we were finally rewarded with our first glimpses of blue skies once we got further up the ridge line.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3025.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>Shortly before reaching the final (fairly steep) ascent to the summit, the clouds cleared up seemingly out of nowhere.  Truly a spectacular view down the valley towards the <hl>Oberaarhorn</hl> (still shrouded in the clouds in this picture).</em>
</p>

## Sidelhorn

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3018.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>The last bit to the top of the <hl>Sidelhorn</hl> was quite steep but generally not exposed.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3051.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>Despite it being August, it was very cold up here.  Quite a bit of the path close to the summit was ice covered, which made an otherwise (relatively) easy ascent become a little sketchy.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3062.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>A view from the summit of the <hl>Sidelhorn</hl>; we had the top of the mountain entirely to ourselves.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3090.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>View towards the <hl>Nufenenpass</hl> (up the valley but not visible here).</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3142.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>A small window in the clouds let us have a brief view of the <hl>Furkapass</hl> (road on the right side of the image).</em>
</p>

## Descent to the Triebteseewli

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3172.JPG" alt="" class="portrait">
    <em>The descent along the western ridge line towards the <hl>Triebtesee-Licken</hl> required a little bit of scrambling at times, but was not exposed.  The main hindrance we had to watch out for (similar to the ascent) were the sneaky patches of ice on some of the rocks.</em>

## Return via the Husegghütte

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3241.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>We returned to the <hl>Grimselpass</hl> via a path that was below (but parallel to) the path we took up to the <hl>Sidelhorn</hl>.  Despite being a little icy on the way up, we didn't really hit much in the way of snow apart from a few patches (like this one) that had accumulated in some of the gullies.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="IMG_3271.JPG" alt="" class="landscape">
    <em>This was something we're always careful about regardless of where we're hiking in Switzerland, but especially if there are signs warning us about it.  Luckily we didn't find any UXOs on our hike.</em>
