    <em>The <hl>Limmerensee</hl> as seen from the <hl>Muttenchopf</hl>.</em>
</p>

## Quick Summary

- Took a (completely over-engineered) cable car from <hl>Tierfed</hl> to <hl>Kalktrittli</hl>.
- From <hl>Kalktrittli</hl> we took the newly constructed path which had been blown out of the side of the mountain.
  - While the path is quite wide and very well maintained, it is <hl>extremely</hl> exposed (near-vertical drop of around 800 m).
- Hiked up towards the <hl>Muttenwändli</hl> via the <hl>Nüschentäli</hl>.
  - We had a few small snowfields to cross despite it being mid-summer.
- Coffee and Wähe at the <hl>Muttseehütte SAC</hl>.
- Quick pit-stop on the <hl>Muttenchopf</hl>.
- Descent to the <hl>Limmerensee</hl>.
- Return via the <hl>access tunnel</hl> used for constructing the dams at the Limmerensee and the Muttsee.

## Kalktrittli

  <em>Taking the cable car up from <hl>Tierfed</hl> to <hl>Kalktrittli</hl>.  This cable car was initially built for when they were constructing the expansion to the dam at the Muttsee.  This cable car was built to transport vehicles and huge amounts of materials to the construction site and not a couple tourists looking for an epic hiking trail ;)</em>

  <em>There are only two official paths that lead to the <hl>Muttseehütte</hl>.  The first one (left arrow; this is the one we'll be taking here) goes up along a newly constructed path to the <hl>Nüschentäli</hl> while the second goes through an access tunnel that leads directly though the mountain.  We'll be taking the access tunnel on the way back.</em>

  <em>The view forwards towards the Limmerentobel (valley where the sunlight is coming in from).  According to the topography map, it would be around an 800 m drop if we were to fall here.  We definitely had to watch our step.</em>

  <em>There were a few very short passages like this which were secured by chains.  They definitely wouldn't have been necessary, but it helped to make the ascent a little more relaxed.</em>

## Muttenchopf and the Limmerensee

  <em>This glacial valley is absolutely incredible.  It's uncommon to find these sorts of fjord-like valleys in Switzerland.  The <hl>Muttenchopf</hl> is the plateau on the right side.</em>

  <em>This is the kind of place I imagine Swiss geology students go to for fieldwork.  Apart from all of the well defined folds, the offset layer to the left of the snow covered gully might be the most spectacular textbook example of a reverse fault I have ever seen.</em>

  <em>Finally down at the <hl>Limmerensee</hl>.  This is the first part of the hike where we saw quite a number of people.  There was a school class here for a field trip, but they had only taken the cable car up and walked through the access tunnel to get here (hence, not taking the hiking trail).  That approach would likely make for a good family outing on a weekend.</em>
</p>

## Return Through the Access Tunnel
<hl>NOTE: We were REQUIRED to wear a safety vest through the tunnel.  There was a box with a bunch of them at the door leading into the tunnel; we took one from this bin and then deposited it back in the box at the other end of the tunnel.</hl>

  <em>Bruno sporting a safety vest inside the access tunnel.  Pretty neat that they make this accessible to the public.  It is also quite a nice shortcut without which this hike would likely not have been doable in a day.</em>
