Any outdoor activity, especially those in the mountains, inherently possesses
risks which may lead to severe injury or death.  This website is not meant to
serve as an educational guide or be a substitute for proper alpine training, but
rather a general informational reference.  It is your own responsibility to
acquire the necessary training and expertise to ensure the safety of yourself
and others while in the mountains.

The GPS routes and maps are also merely included to serve as an approximate
overview for the route we decided to take.  However, the accuracy or validity of
these routes cannot be guaranteed and should not be relied on in place of alpine
orientation and navigation skills.
